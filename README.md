# ‚ú® Hi, I'm __mikeatta__

**`Web Developer (Frontend / Backend / Web Design)`**

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
I am a full-stack developer, currently pursuing a degree in computer science. I started building software solutions to solve my own problems. I build most of my projects from the ground up, using third-party libraries or templates when needed, or where building off of others' projects is a more optimal approach. In design, I favor minimalism, as I believe a clean and bold UI is the best way of providing the necessary information to the user.

  Most of my experience comes from building apps for personal use, and building Uni projects. In the past, I've gathered experience in IT and Software Development through internships at Phillips Lighting (currently Signify) as well as working for a small WordPress web design & development studio.
