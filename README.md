# ‚ú® Hi, I'm __mikeatta__

**`Full-stack / AI Developer`**

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
I am a full-time student of computer science with a specialization in machine learning. I work on web applications that leverage AI. My favorite part of the development process is API integration, MLOps/DevOps, and web scraping for useful data. In my spare time, I build personal projects to automate my own business-related tasks like listing management and warm-outreach scrapers.

<details>
  <summary><h3>Past experience</h3></summary>
  Most of my experience comes from building apps for my own use, for family members, and learning new technologies and frameworks for university course projects. In the past, I've gathered IT and software development experience through internships at Philips Lighting (currently Signify) as well as working with a local web design and development studio.
